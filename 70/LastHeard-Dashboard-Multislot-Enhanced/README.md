# LastHeard Dashboard Multislot for 7 inch screen

This is a simple last-heard-table for an enhanced 7 inch screen by Nextion.
Including the HMI and TFT files for quick flashing or editing.

The screen operates at 115200 baud. This is set on the MMDVM page. Select
layout 4 in your `MMDVM.ini`. On Pi-Star that would be ON7LDS 3 HS.

Feel free to modify it to your needs.

If you re-publish your screen based on my version a link back to the repository
or my website [oe7drt.com](https://oe7drt.com) is well appreciated.

[I made a blog post][blog post] about this screen.
